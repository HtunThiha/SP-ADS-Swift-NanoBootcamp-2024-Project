# SP-ADS-Swift-NanoBootcamp-2024-Project ï£¿
  This is the project our team did for Singapore Polytechnic Apple Developer Society's 5-day Bootcamp of SwiftUI and Xcode.
  
## Application Name: SwiftCab SG

## Problem statement ðŸ”Ž
  There are many taxi services, offering different ranges of prices. This results in users to check different taxi applications, which takes more time.
  
## How SwiftCab SG solves the problem ðŸ’¡
  SwiftCab SG is a demo project of collecting data from different taxi services, displaying them at the same time in SwiftCab SG and allowing user to book, so that the user doesn't need to look at different applications for a taxi price.
